			<h2>The Eye of Universe</h2>
			<div class="info-normal-text">The estimated distance is about 215 parsecs (700 light-years). It is similar
				in
				appearance to the Cat’s
				Eye Nebula and the Ring Nebula, whose size, age, and physical characteristics are similar to the
				Dumbbell Nebula, varying only in its relative proximity and the appearance from the equatorial viewing
				angle. The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the “Eye of God” in pop culture, as well as
				the “Eye of Sauron”.
				The Helix Nebula is an example of a planetary nebula, formed by an intermediate to low-mass star, which
				sheds its outer layers near the end of its evolution.
